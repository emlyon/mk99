3. Predicting deals image:tilkee.png[width="100"]

4. Predictive maintenance image:cat.jpg[width="100"]

.Predict: The hard part
|===

1. Collecting data ("cold start problem")

2. Risk missing the long tail, algorithmic discrimination, stereotyping

3. Neglect of novelty
|===


==  2. SUGGEST

==  !

2. Selling aggregated indicators image:edf.jpg[width="100"]

3. Selling credit scores

|===

==  !

.Enrich: the hard part
|===

|===


==  5. RANK / MATCH / COMPARE
==  !

[.stretch]
image::rank.jpg[align="center"]


==  !

.Rank / Match / Compare: the ones doing it
|===

1. Search engines ranking results image:google.jpg[width="100"]

2. Yelp, Tripadvisor, etc… which rank places image:tripadvisor.jpg[width="100"]

3. Any system that needs to filter out best quality entities among a crowd of candidates

|===

==  !

.Rank / Match / Compare: the hard part
|===

1. Finding emergent, implicit attributes

2. Insuring consistency of the ranking

3. Avoid gaming of the system by the users

|===


==  6. SEGMENT / CLASSIFY
==  !

[.stretch]

==  !

.Segment / classify: the ones doing it
|===

1. Tools for discovery / exploratory analysis by segmentation

2. Diagnostic tools (spam or not? buy, hold or sell? healthy or not?) image:medimsight.png[width="100"]

|===

==  !

.Segment / classify: the hard part
|===

1. Evaluating the quality of the comparison

2. Dealing with boundary cases

3. Choosing between a supervised and unsupervised approach (how many categories?)

|===


==  7. GENERATE (experimental!)
==  !

[.stretch]

==  !
.Generate (experimental!): the ones doing it

|===

==  !

.Generate (experimental!): the hard part
