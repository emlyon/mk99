[TIP]
====
Not a closed list, not a recipe!
Rather, these are essential building blocks for a strategy of value creation based on data.
====

== 1. Predict
== !
[.stretch]

== !


==== a. Examples of companies
== !
1. Predicting crime image:predpol.png[pdfwidth="100", width="100", book="keep"]
2. Predicting deals image:tilkee.png[pdfwidth="100", width="100", book="keep"]
3. Predictive maintenance image:cat.jpg[pdfwidth="100", width="100", book="keep"]

== !
==== b. Obstacles and difficulties
== !
1. The https://indatalabs.com/blog/data-science/cold-start-problem-in-recommender-systems[((cold start problem))]
2. Risk missing the ((long tail)), ((algorithmic discrimination)), ((stereotyping))
3. Neglect of novelty

== 2. Suggest
== !
[.stretch]

==== a. Examples of companies
== !
1. Amazon’s product recommendation system image:amazon.jpg[pdfwidth="100", width="100", book="keep"]
2. Google’s “Related searches…” image:google.jpg[pdfwidth="100", width="100", book="keep"]
3. Retailer’s personalized recommendations image:auchan.jpg[pdfwidth="100", width="100", book="keep"]

== !
==== b. Obstacles and difficulties
== !
1. The ((cold start problem)), managing https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2016.08.014[((serendipity))] and http://wwwconference.org/proceedings/www2014/proceedings/p677.pdf[((filter bubble effects))].
2. Finding the ((value proposition)) which goes beyond the simple “you purchased this, you’ll like that”

== 3. Curate
== !
[.stretch]
image::curation.jpg[pdfwidth="25%", align="center"]
== !


==== a. Examples of companies
== !
1. ((Clarivate Analytics)) curating metadata(((data, data curation))) from scientific publishing image:crv_logo_rgb_rev.png[pdfwidth="100", width="100", book="keep"]
2. ((Nielsen)) and IRI curating and selling retail data image:nielsen.jpg[width="100"] image:iri.jpg[pdfwidth="100", width="100", book="keep"]
3. ImDB curating and selling movie data image:imdb.jpg[pdfwidth="100", width="100", book="keep"]
4. NomadList providing practical info on global cities for nomad workers image:nomadlist.jpg[pdfwidth="100", width="100", book="keep"]

== !
==== b. Obstacles and difficulties
== !
1. Slow progress: curation needs ((human labor)) to insure high accuracy, it does not scale the way a computerized process would.
2. Must maintain continuity: missing a single year or month hurts the value of the overall dataset.
3. Scaling up / right incentives for the workforce: https://www.wired.com/story/amazons-turker-crowd-has-had-enough/[the workforce doing the digital labor of curation should be paid fairly], which is not the case yet.
4. Quality control


== 4. Enrich
== !
[.stretch]
image::enrich.jpg[pdfwidth="25%", align="center",width="500"]
== !


==== Examples of companies
== !
1. Selling methods and tools to enrich datasets image:watson.png[pdfwidth="100", width="100", book="keep"]
2. Selling aggregated indicators image:edf.jpg[pdfwidth="100", width="100", book="keep"]
3. Selling credit scores

== !
==== Obstacles and difficulties
== !
1. Knowing which cocktail of data is valued by the market
2. Limit duplicability
3. Establish legitimacy

== 5. Rank / match / compare
== !
[.stretch]
image::rank.jpg[pdfwidth="25%", align="center",width="500"]
== !


==== Examples of companies
== !
1. Search engines ranking results image:google.jpg[pdfwidth="100", width="100", book="keep"]
2. Yelp, Tripadvisor, etc… which rank places image:tripadvisor.jpg[pdfwidth="100", width="100", book="keep"]
3. Any system that needs to filter out best quality entities among a crowd of candidates

== !
==== Obstacles and difficulties
== !
1. Finding emergent, implicit attributes (imagine: if you rank things based on just one public feature: not interesting nor valuable)
2. Insuring consistency of the ranking (many rankings are less straightforward than they appear)
3. Avoid gaming of the system by the users (for instance, http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/business/13search.html[companies try to play Google's ranking of search results at their advantage])

== 6. Segment / classify
== !
[.stretch]
image::muffin.jpg[pdfwidth="25%", align="center",width="500"]
== !


==== Examples of companies
== !
1. Tools for discovery / exploratory analysis by ((segmentation))
2. Diagnostic tools (spam or not? buy, hold or sell? healthy or not?) image:medimsight.png[pdfwidth="100", width="100", book="keep"]

== !
==== Obstacles and difficulties
== !
1. Evaluating the quality of the comparison
2. Dealing with boundary cases
3. Choosing between a pre-determined number of segments (like in the k-means) or letting the number of segments emerge

== 7. Generate / synthesize (experimental!)
== !
[.stretch]

==== Obstacles and difficulties
== !
1. Should not create a failed product / false expectations
2. Both classic (think of image:clippy.jpg[pdfwidth="50", width="50", book="keep"]) and frontier science: not sure where it’s going
