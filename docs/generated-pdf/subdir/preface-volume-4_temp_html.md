== A textbook for managers

The target reader for this book is a manager who needs to clearly understand the business stakes of "data science", "big data", "APIs" and "artificial intelligence" so that they can:

- *leverage* these technologies to improve the efficiency of their current business,
- *innovate* with new products and services

The promise of this book is to bring you from a starting point with no knowledge of these technical concepts, to a point where you understand the concepts *and* you can develop "data centric" business projects: when "data" contributes to creating value for customers and all stakeholders.


== Is this too technical or too easy for you?

This book does not assume any technical pre-requisite. It uses simple terms and a progressive learning curve to lead you to a comprehensive understanding of the topics.

If you are unsure, try this simple test: http://bit.ly/essentials-1-test

-> There are 20 topics. See how you score. If the score is below 12, this volume is for you.
