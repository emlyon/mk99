== A textbook for managers

The target reader for this book is a manager who needs to clearly understand what "data science", "big data", "artificial intelligence" so that they can:

- *leverage* these technologies to improve the efficiency of  their existing business,
- *innovate* with new products and services and develop new business guidelines

The promise of this book is to bring you from a starting point with no knowledge of these technical concepts, to a point where you understand the concepts *and* you can develop "data centric" business projects: when "data" contributes to creating value for the customer and all stakeholders.


=== Is this textbook too technical or too easy for me?

If you are unsure, try this simple test: http://bit.ly/essentials-1-test

-> There are 20 topics you should be comfortable answering. See how you score. If the score is low, this book will be of great use.
