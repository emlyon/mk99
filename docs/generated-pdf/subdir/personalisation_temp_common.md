== 1. From segmentation to personalization

//ST: !
Segmentation helps refine the picture from a mass of data to meaningful subgroups of data points.

Why not go down to extreme segmentation: segments the size of an individual?

//ST: !
- Major websites do it (Amazon, Yahoo!, Netflix, etc.)
- Ads providers do it (Facebook)
- News feed do it (Prismatic, Pulse)

//ST: !
Advantages: pinpoint accuracy and relevance
Inconvenient: operational complexity

== 2. Beyond behavior: tracking individual bodies

== 3. The case of *Nicholas Felton* (((Felton, Nicholas))): constant data monitoring

//ST: !
=== a. The Feltron reports

//ST: !
image::nicholas_felton3.jpg[align="center", title="Nicholas Felton"]
{nbsp} +

//ST: !
http://feltron.com/[Nicholas Felton] is a designer and data artist who produced printed annual reports from 2005 to 2014.

These reports synthesize his bodily data and social life, which he measures __constantly__ during the year. This practice (pushed to the extreme in this case) belongs to the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_self[((quantified self))] movement.

//ST: !
=== b. Not just Feltron

//ST: !
Insurance companies are interested in boosting individual health, using connected objects as monitoring devices

//ST: !
Companies are looking to provide a 360 degree solution to health and well being through constant monitoring:

//ST: !

//ST: !
Monitoring on health is also a B2B market to achieve "corporate welfare". See link:resources/corporate_wellness_smartdata_nokia.pdf[Nokia's brochure] on the topic.

== 4. Issues, limits

//ST: !
These technologies open a vast number of issues: from data privacy to the redefinition of well-being, and the grey boundary between monitoring and surveillance.

//ST: !
A full session of this series is devoted to discussing these issues.

//ST: !
For the moment, let us just repeat cautionary remarks already mentioned in a different session:

//ST: !
=== a. "personalization" has been blamed for reinforcing "bubbles" or "tribes" views of the world (http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1808[paying version] of the paper, free version https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kartik_Hosanagar/publication/228233814_Will_the_Global_Village_Fracture_Into_Tribes_Recommender_Systems_and_Their_Effects_on_Consumer_Fragmentation/links/0046352960e0b2e12c000000/Will-the-Global-Village-Fracture-Into-Tribes-Recommender-Systems-and-Their-Effects-on-Consumer-Fragmentation.pdf[here]).

//ST: !
Content personalization is also blamed for favoring political polarization via an "echo chamber effect": social media tend to show me content I already agree with (paying version of the paper http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740624X16300375[here], free version https://www.academia.edu/24798528/Political_Polarization_on_Twitter_Implications_for_the_Use_of_Social_Media_in_Digital_Governments?auto=download[here]).

//ST: !
=== b. Personalizing the customer relationship, even when effective, is not inherently a good thing.

//ST: !
It has been shown that the http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/summer-of-sharing-share-a-coke-campaign-rolls-out-in-the-us[Coca-Cola #ShareaCoke campaign] is effective at making more children choose a soda with a label to their name, over a healthy drink (paying version of the study http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijpo.12193/abstract[here], free version not available).

//ST: !
=== c. Does personalization always need technology?

//ST: !
Companies rated with the ((customer)) service do personalization differently: with humans.

//ST: !
See how ((Zappos)) offers a great service to their customers:
